# HosterRed-ProxyBackend
## Project overview
This is a set of Python CLI scripts to generate a reverse proxy (HTTPs only for now) configs for HAProxy. Simplicity is a key in my projects, so as a result a single YAML file is used as a database to keep all of the sites you need.
</br>To get started with this project run an installation script:
```
# As root user run:
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaroslav-gwit/HosterRed-ProxyBackend/main/install.sh | bash
# Or with debugging enabled
